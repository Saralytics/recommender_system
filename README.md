# Music Recommender System
Group Project by AMOS M., LI X., PABLO B., SARANG Z., VANIA C.

Recommender systems are software tools and techniques aimed at providing relevant suggestions of products to a user. With the increase of e-business services, recommender systems become very important since they are a valuable tool to deal with the high amount of item choices presented to users, being a differentiation factor that generates an important amount of income for companies.

Using a dataset with Amazon user reviews (explicit numerical rating and contextual comments) on Digital Music, released by UC San Diego1, the objective of this project is to create three types of recommender systems2:

a. a collaborative filtering, based on the user ratings;
a. a content-based, leveraging the textual content associated to the reviews; and
b. a hybrid approach, that combines collaborative filtering and content-based recommender
systems.

This project was developed in Python and a notebook is delivered together with this report.
